# Gmail Sender Application

This is a Python-based Gmail sender application with a user-friendly GUI built using PyQt6. It allows users to compose and send emails with attachments via Gmail's SMTP server, using SSL encryption for secure communication. The app also supports HTML editing for email content, allowing you to create rich-text emails.
